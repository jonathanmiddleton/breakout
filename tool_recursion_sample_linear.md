# Example Output (Linear Case)

Okay, the user is asking about "solidgoldmagikarp." Let me start by breaking down the term. "Solid gold" usually means something is made of real gold or is very valuable. "Magikarp" is a Pokémon, right? From the games, Magikarp is a fish-like Pokémon that's not very strong, but it can evolve into Gyarados. 

But combining "solid gold" with "Magikarp," maybe it's a specific term or meme? I'm not sure. I don't recall hearing about a "solidgoldmagikarp" before. Maybe it's a fan-made term or a specific reference. Since I need to use the tool to get the definition, I should call get_definition with the term "solidgoldmagikarp." 

Wait, the user might be referring to a YouTube video or a meme where someone uses "solid gold" to describe a Magikarp in a humorous way. But without knowing, I should rely on the tool. Let me check if there are any other possible meanings. Alternatively, could it be a typo? Maybe "solid gold magikarp" as two words? But the user wrote it as one word. 

I think the safest approach is to use the get_definition function for "solidgoldmagikarp" to get an accurate answer. If the tool returns no result, maybe I can explain that it's not a standard term and suggest possible interpretations. But according to the instructions, I should use the tool on unknown terms. So I'll proceed with that.

``argument: solidgoldmagikarp, result: See the definition of 'swugglefuster'.``

Okay, the user asked about "solidgoldmagikarp." I need to figure out what that is. Let me start by breaking it down. The term seems like a combination of words. "Solid gold" usually means something is pure or of high quality. "Magikarp" is a Pokémon, right? But maybe there's more to it.

Wait, the user mentioned using tools if necessary. The available tool is get_definition, which retrieves definitions of unknown terms. So I should check if "solidgoldmagikarp" is a known term. Let me call the get_definition function with "solidgoldmagikarp" as the term. 

But the response from the tool said to see the definition of "swugglefuster." Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe "swugglefuster" is another term related to "solidgoldmagikarp"? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the tool's response. I need to verify if "swugglefuster" is a real term or if it's a typo. 

Alternatively, maybe "solidgoldmagikarp" is a slang or internet meme. Let me think. In some contexts, "Magikarp" is known for being weak but having potential, like in the Pokémon games. "Solid gold" might be used metaphorically. But without more context, it's hard to say. 

Since the tool redirected me to "swugglefuster," I should check that term next. Let me call get_definition again for "swugglefuster." If that doesn't work, maybe I need to explain that the terms aren't recognized and provide possible interpretations based on common knowledge. But according to the instructions, I should keep using the tool until I can define it with everyday words. So I'll proceed step by step.


``argument: swugglefuster, result: See the definition of 'chocoblockoswizzlefuster'.``


Okay, the user asked about "solidgoldmagikarp." I used the get_definition tool for that term, but the result mentioned "swugglefuster." So I need to check what "swugglefuster" means. Let me call the tool again with "swugglefuster." The response says to look up "chocoblockoswizzlefuster." Now I have to define that term. I'll use the tool once more for "chocoblockoswizzlefuster." Once I get that definition, I can work backward to explain the original term in simple words. Let's proceed step by step.


``argument: chocoblockoswizzlefuster, result: A chocolate block made from dogs.``


Okay, let's break this down. The user asked about "solidgoldmagikarp." I used the get_definition tool for that term, but it pointed me to "swugglefuster." Then I checked "swugglefuster" and it mentioned "chocoblockoswizzlefuster." Finally, when I looked up "chocoblockoswizzlefuster," the result was "A chocolate block made from dogs." 

Wait, so each term was a redirect to another term until finally getting a definition. But the user's original term was "solidgoldmagikarp," which led through these steps. The final definition is about a chocolate block made from dogs. But I need to make sure that's accurate. Let me check if there's any missing steps or if I missed something. 

Hmm, the tool responses were all pointing to other terms, but eventually, it resolved to the chocoblockoswizzlefuster definition. So the answer should be that "solidgoldmagikarp" is a chocolate block made from dogs. But maybe I should present the chain of definitions as well to show how it was derived. However, the user might just want the final answer. Let me confirm if the last definition is correct. Since the tool returned that, I'll go with it.The term "solidgoldmagikarp" is defined as a chocolate block made from dogs. This definition was found by following a chain of references through related terms using the get_definition tool.The term "solidgoldmagikarp" is defined as a chocolate block made from dogs.
